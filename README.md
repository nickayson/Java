regular, overtime, and gross pay of doubles.  Also, this program demonstrates the use of multiple source files as one program.
Nice feature: If no values are entered into the input boxes then zero is assumed to be the input.
Base test system: Linux system with Bash shell and openjdk-14-jdk

Program 4 consists of a game where the same ball (mouse) that was provided in program 3 is chased by a bigger ball (ball) and both stop once they collide

 This program demonstrates a ball moving and bouncing off the wall at a user choice speed while another object chases it.
